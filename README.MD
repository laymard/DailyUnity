# DailyUnity challenges

Inside this repo you will find my works on the [/r/DailyUnity](https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyUnity/) challenges.
There is one folder for each challenge with its description.

Why am I doing this ? Because Unity is fun, and these little exercise make me practice that engine :) .
